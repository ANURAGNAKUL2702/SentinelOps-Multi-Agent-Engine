Generate 3-5 root cause hypotheses from the following pre-computed evidence signals.

For each hypothesis provide:
- theory: A clear, actionable theory statement
- category: One of (database, application, network, deployment, configuration, infrastructure, security)
- severity: One of (critical, high, medium, low)
- evidence_supporting: List of evidence descriptions that support this theory
- evidence_contradicting: Evidence that weakens this theory
- causal_chain: Step-by-step showing how root cause propagated
- reasoning: Why you believe this is a plausible root cause

Respond with ONLY valid JSON:
