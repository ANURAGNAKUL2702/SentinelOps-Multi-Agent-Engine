Given a root cause hypothesis and supporting evidence, construct a detailed
causal chain showing how the root cause propagated through the system.

Each step should identify:
- The service affected
- What happened at that service
- The causal relationship to the next step (causes, contributes_to, correlates_with)

Respond with ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "chain": [
    {"step": 1, "service": "<name>", "event": "<what>", "relationship": "causes"}
  ],
  "root_cause_service": "<first service in chain>",
  "terminal_effect": "<final user-visible symptom>",
  "confidence": <float 0.0-1.0>
}
