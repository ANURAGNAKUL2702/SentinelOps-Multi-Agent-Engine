Given the classification results, produce a final MetricsAgentOutput.

The output must include:
- agent: "metrics_agent" (fixed)
- service: The service name being analyzed
- time_window: The analysis time window
- anomalous_metrics: List of classified anomalous metrics
- correlations: List of significant metric correlations
- system_summary: Overall system health assessment
- confidence_score: Analysis confidence (0.0 to 1.0)
- confidence_reasoning: Explanation of confidence level
- classification_source: "llm" or "deterministic"

Each anomalous metric must have:
  metric_name, current_value, previous_value, baseline_mean, baseline_stddev,
  zscore, deviation_percent, growth_rate, is_anomalous, anomaly_type,
  severity, trend, threshold_breached, reasoning
