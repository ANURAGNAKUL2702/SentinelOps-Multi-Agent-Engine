Analyze the following metric signals and classify each anomalous metric.

For each anomalous metric, determine:
1. anomaly_type: one of ["spike", "sustained", "oscillating", "none"]
2. severity: one of ["critical", "high", "medium", "low", "info"]
3. trend: one of ["sudden_spike", "increasing", "stable", "decreasing"]
4. reasoning: A brief explanation of why this classification was chosen

Also provide:
- correlations: Pairs of metrics that are statistically related
- system_summary: Overall assessment of system health
- confidence_score: 0.0 to 1.0 indicating analysis confidence
- confidence_reasoning: Why this confidence level was assigned
