### Example 1: Missed Database Failure
AI Verdict: "network_partition_between_services"
Ground Truth: "database_connection_pool_exhaustion"
Accuracy: 0.25

Analysis:
{
  "recommendations": [
    "Improve database metrics monitoring: connection pool usage, active connections, and wait times should be primary signals.",
    "Add correlation between increased latency and database health indicators.",
    "Review dependency graph to ensure database is correctly modeled as upstream dependency for all data-dependent services."
  ],
  "analysis": "The AI misattributed cascading database failures to a network partition because the symptoms (timeouts, connection errors) are similar. The key differentiator — connection pool metrics going to 100% utilization — was not weighted heavily enough by the Metrics Agent.",
  "confidence_in_analysis": 0.85
}

### Example 2: Correct Diagnosis
AI Verdict: "auth-service crash due to OOM"
Ground Truth: "auth-service crash due to memory_leak"
Accuracy: 0.92

Analysis:
{
  "recommendations": [
    "Minor: Distinguish between OOM kill and gradual memory leak in terminology for more precise diagnosis.",
    "Add memory trend analysis (gradual increase vs sudden spike) to differentiate leak from spike."
  ],
  "analysis": "The AI correctly identified the service and failure mode but used imprecise terminology. OOM and memory_leak are closely related — the root cause identification is essentially correct but could be more specific about the mechanism.",
  "confidence_in_analysis": 0.90
}

### Example 3: Hallucinated Service
AI Verdict: "queue-service backpressure causing payment delays"
Ground Truth: "payment-service deployment with breaking API change"
Accuracy: 0.15

Analysis:
{
  "recommendations": [
    "Critical: The AI referenced 'queue-service' which does not exist in the infrastructure. Strengthen service name validation in the Hypothesis Agent.",
    "Add deployment event detection: correlate error spikes with recent deployments.",
    "Improve the Root Cause Agent's evidence validation to cross-check service names against the service catalog."
  ],
  "analysis": "The AI hallucinated a non-existent service ('queue-service') and constructed a plausible but fabricated causal chain. The actual root cause was a deployment issue, which the agents failed to detect because deployment events were not included in the evidence synthesis.",
  "confidence_in_analysis": 0.80
